# Code Translator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# About

This project was built using React and the OpenAI API. I've themed this project around being a code translator. The app will take in a code snippet as input from the text box then send it to the OpenAI API. OpenAI will then parse the give code snippet and translate it into natural language so it is more easily understandable.

There are 3 options for the code snippet's language, those being Python 3, Java, and C++. The app will still take input if the langauge is doesn't match your selected version or if it isn't even a code snippet, but the output might not be accurate if you choose to do so.

A Dark and Light mode is also included in the application for your viewing preference. I also have a link to the OpenAI documentation and a link to this GitHub repo to view the code.

# Local Testing
